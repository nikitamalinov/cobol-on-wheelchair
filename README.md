COBOL on Wheelchair
===================

Micro web-framework for COBOL (in statu nascendi)

OK, [COBOL-ON-COGS](http://www.coboloncogs.org/HOME.HTM) was funny, but why not try that for real? ;)

Things you'll need to run _COBOL on Wheelchair_:

* [GNU Cobol](http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/) (```sudo apt-get install open-cobol```)

### For OS X Mavericks users

Due to compatibility issues with `open-cobol` on OS X Mavericks, it is recommended to install a specific version known to work well on this system. Run the following command instead of the generic installation command:
```
brew install open-cobol@1.1
```
* Ability to run cgi-bin on Apache server


Installation
-------------

```
git clone https://github.com/azac/cobol-on-wheelchair/

```
